This is a project that demonstrates how to build a simple Gen AI web app using Anthropic Claude and Streamlit. This application is deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud. Do note that the .env file is not pushed to this repository as we are manually setting the API Key via Streamlit Community Cloud app settings.
